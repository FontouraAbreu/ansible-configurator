# Ansible Configurator

This is a simple tool to help me configure my personal Linux environment.

The ideia is to have a simple way to configure my environment in a new machine.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the `install-ansible.sh` script
3. Execute the `ansible-playbook` command to configure your environment

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
